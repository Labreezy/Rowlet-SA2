This is rowlet.

Rowlet will count the frames someone has paused in a gameplay video of sonic adventure 2: battle.

To use just pass a filename in as the first argument to the script, will also output a file with all the pauses removed if you want to look super swagular or something.

I cba at the moment but flip the if statement to have it only save pauses to file on line 97.

Warning: if your overlay is REALLY blue (hi drumbasher old layout) then try and crop the gameplay out before attempting to process footage. False positives are real.
